mee with the will of the Good that they should be
good through the fact tm they exim but it is not
in moranno with the will οἲ one who is not whive
thu a thxng have a certain property making it whioe
in virtue of ists Being; for it was not the will of One
who is white that gave them Being. And so they
nte white simply because One who was not white
villosi them m be white; hut. they ue good thmugh
the fut that they exist beaune One who was good
vinea them ω be good Oughe, then, by pmty of
reason, all things ω be just hemme He is just who
wille-i them to be? Thac is not so either. Fur ιο
be good involves Being, ω be just involves m act,
1³01 fflm being md act-iun are mentium ω be good
md ω be just ue one md the same fo? Him.
But being md action ue not idenfieal sm· us, for we
tre not simple. For us, then, gomis-ess is not the
sume thing ns justine, but we all have the sane sort
of Being in virtue of our existence. Therefore ull
things ure good, but ⁸11 things 'ure not just Fimlly,
good is n genn-nl, but just is a speeies, and this speeies
dues not npply ω dl. Wherefore some things ne
just, others ase something else, but ull things are

good.
