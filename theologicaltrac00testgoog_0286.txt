Wherefore since thou hast seen what is the form
of perfeci md imperfect good, now 1 think we must
show in who: this pei-fection of happiness is placed.
And inquire first whether there can be any such
good mont in the world, os thou hm ,ἰώ-κω lest,
contr ω truth, we be deceived with m empty
show o thought. But it oennot be denied thui there
is smne such thing extant which is ns it were the
founhin of all goudnese. For nn that is said w be
imperfect is so termed for the wmt it hhth of per-
fection whence it foll->wem tint ff in any kind
we find something imperfect, there must needs be
something perfect also in the same kind. Fur if we
take away perfectior: we annot so much u devise
how there should he ‚ny imperfectiori. For the
nature of things bega-u not ἥσω thnt which is
defecfive md not eom leve, but, prooeeding [mm
entire ami ubsolute, {neth into that which is
extreme and enfeehled. But if, aa we shewed

solid and perfect happiness also? “Thou hut?
quoth 1, “mucluded most finoly ond most troiyff'
“Now where this good dwellethy quodi she, “eon-
nider this. The commun contest of men's minda
proveth ssiat God the Prinee of 211 things is good.
