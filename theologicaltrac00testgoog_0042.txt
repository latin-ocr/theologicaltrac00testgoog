DE TRINITATE

thereby perpetual effinse of our present time, tlut
is w say, sempiternityn¹

lt is just the same with the mtegurles of wndition
and aetivity For example, we my “A num runs,
elothed: “aod mles, possessing all thing& Here
again nothing substantia! is asserted of either subjeet;
ιιι feet ιιι the mtegoriee we lnve hitherto named
nise t’mm what lies ouhside substanee, ond all of them,
so ω speak, refer to something uther than substance„
The dsfferenee between the categonee is easily seen
by nn example. Thus, the teu-ms “mm” and “Geni’'
refer ω the subsnnce fin virtue os which the subject
is—mnn nr God. The herm “just'' refers bo tlte
quality iu virtue of which the subject is something,
viz. just3 the term “great‘’ m the quantity in virtue
es which fle is something, viz. grat. No other ente>
gon-y save substance, quality, md quantity teser tu the
substance of the su'bjeet If 1 say of one “he is ιιι
the masket' ον’ ‘eve where,'' Ι am npplying the
ategory of pleee, whie Ἦ is not ι category of the sub.
suffice, like “just ιιι virtue of justice. so if 1 say,
‘¹ he runs, He mles, he is now, He is ever,'' 1 make
reference ω netivity or time—if indeed God's “ever”
ean be described ns time—but not ω a mtegory of
substance, uke‘ ‘great ’“ in virtue uf greamess

Fiunlly, we must not look for the entegonen of
situation and sivity in God, for they simply are
not w be ίόιιιίἕ*ε Him
