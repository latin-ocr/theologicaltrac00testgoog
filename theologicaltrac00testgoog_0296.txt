OONSOLAT. PHlLosom-x. 111.

By lust which deth them tie in cruel ahaim:
Here is a seat for men oppoest,
Here is n port of pleasant κείς
Here huy h wxeteh have refuge hom his pam.
No gold, which 'fagus‘ nands bestow,
Nor which ou Hermus* hamks doth flow,
Nor precihus sumes which seomhffl Indiam ,φησι
Can clear the sharpness of the mind,
But rather make it fus more blind,
And in the further depth of dnxkness set.
For this that sets our sauls οιι work
Buried in mves of earth doth lux-k„
But heaven is guided by another lighh
Which causeth us ω shun the dxx-kl*
And who this light doth truly mark,
Μηδὲ neoda cle-hy that Phoebus* benus are brightl'
