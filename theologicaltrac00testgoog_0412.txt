CONSOLAT. Pfflmsom-i. V,

As a gloss rendere emptya shepes ns things,
Who then em show from whence that motion springs
By force of which the mind hll things doth know?
oi- hy what skffl ue several things espied?
And being known what power deth them divide,
And thus divided deth :gain unite,
And with h various joumey 0st aspires
To highest things, and οῆ again retires
To ineest, nothing being out of sight,
And when she back unm herself doch unove,
Doth nli the falsehoods by the truth reprove?
Thin vigour needs must be un active muse,
And with nime powerful forces must be deekt,
Tkmn that which from those forms, that do reflect
From outward mtter, ³11 her virtue drawa
And yet in living bodies passion's might
Doth before, whose office is ω meite,
An the first mouens in the mind w make.
As when the light unu» our eyes appears,
Or some lond voice is wunded in oui· ears,
Theti doth the strength uf the dull mind uweke
These phhntasies which she retains withim
She sumn. up such notions ω begin,
Whose objects with their natures best agree,
And thus applying them ω outward things,
She jains the externa ψῃ, which thence she brings
With forms which in herself included be.
