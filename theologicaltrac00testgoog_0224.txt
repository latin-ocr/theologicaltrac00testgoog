Τοο much the former age was blest,

When fields their pleased owners failed not,
Whn, with no slothful lust «marest,

Broke their long fusis with ωσι-ηε ens’ly got<
No wine with honey mixed was,

Nor did they „sun m purple. colom neem
They slept upon the wholesome

And their eool drink did feteh from rivers deep.
The pines did hide finem with their shade,

No men-chum through the dangerous billows went,
Nor with deme of ειη-ιώ] tude

Their πῶς into foreign munh-xes sem„

The mis-dn of soldiers with their dnunting munda,

Dyed with the ἀπωθέει] blood of gaping wounds.
For how could my fury dnw

The mind of mn ω sth- up war in mn,
When nothing but θυαε wounds he. saw,

And for his blood no recompensa she-1111 gain?

In these our lntm hapless times retum!
Now the desire uf having gold

Doth like the naming flres of Aetna bum.
