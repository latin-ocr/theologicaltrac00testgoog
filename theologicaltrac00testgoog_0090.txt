DE FIDE CATHOLICA

with the glst of resurrection, enter upon mteery.
And this is u firm principle of our religion, ιο
believe not only that men's souls do not perish, hut
thot their very bodies, wlueh the coming ol· death
had destroyed, reeuver their first state by tlle bliss
that is to be. This Catholic claui-eh, then, spread
throughout the world, rs known hy three particular
marks ε whatever is believed and taught in it has the
authority of the Scriptures, or of universal tradition,
or ut least of its own und proper usage. And this
authority is binding on the whole Church us is also
the universal tradition uf the Fathers, while euch
separate ehureh eruens und is governed hy lts private
constitution und itu proper rites according to differ-
enee ofloeullty md the good judgment of euch. All,
therefore, that the faithful now expect is that the
eud or the world w-ill come, that all corruptible things
shall pass away, that men shall rlse for future judge-
ment, thut each shall 'receive reward according to his
deserte und abido in the lot assigned to him for ever
und for uye3 und the sule reward of bliss will be the
contemplntion ol· the Alnughty, so fur, tlnt is, us the
creature may look on the Creator, to the end that
the number of the uugels uruy he ‚uude up from
these und the heuvenly elty filled where the virgln‘u
Son is Klng and where will be everlustlng joy,
dellghtjfood, luhour, und unendlng praue of the
Creator.
