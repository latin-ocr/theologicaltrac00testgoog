united to God, so that the Nature seexmd tu be
mnde one. Or if this be not his opinion, since he
says thet there were twa Nat-ires before the unior:
md one aster, supposing the union to be established
ty conception, en alternative view may be tlut
Christ indeed took a body from Mur-y but that
before He wok it the Natum of Godhend und
muhood were different: but the Nature assumed
hemme oue with that οἲ Godheud into which it
passed. But if he thinks that this union was effecte-1
not by conception but by resimeetlorr, we shall
luve to assume that this too happened in une os
two wuys; m'ther Christ was eoneeived und did nol
assume a body stom M or He did assume ssah
fmm her, aud there were until indeed He rose) two
Naturffi which became one aster the Resurrectionr
From these alternatives ι dilemma arises which we
will examine as follows: Christ who was bom of
Mury either did or did not take human flesh from
her. If Eutyches does not admit that He took it
from her, then let him say what mmhood He put
nu to come nmung us—that which had fallen through
sinful disobedience or another? lf it was the mnn-
hood of that mm from whom all men descend, what
mmhood did divinity invffit? For if that flesh in
which He was born <nime unt of the seed of Abraham
and of David and firmll of Mesy, let Eutyches show
frum what mm's fleslt e desoended, since, aster the
flat mn, all inmun flesh is derived from hum-rr
ssah, But if he simu mme my child of mm beside
