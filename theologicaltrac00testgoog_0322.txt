For I have swist md nimble wings which will ascend

With which when thy quick mind is elad, it will the

And bg„ b‘elygnd {ahc airy globe, md wntery clouds

Pming the fige which'scorehing heae deth from the
havens' swist enum receive,

Until it reneh the suu-ry house, md get to tremi
bright Phoebus’ ways,

Follnwing the ehilly sire's pam· wmpndon of his
flashing mys,

Ami true che circle of the suus which in the nighae
to us appeu,

And having myed there Iong enough go on beyond
the fan-theat sphere,

Sitti-{ig ἔξω the highest orb panther of the glomus

Wheregthe grat Κῶς his seeptre holds, and the
world's :eius ἀυτὴ guide night,

And,mfidrm in his swan ehu-iot, deth everythiug in

er set.

Unto this mn when thou m brought, thy omma-y,
which thou ffidst form,

Thou then wilt ehfflenge m &hyselfi saying: ‘This is

Where I was bom, mai in this mil my feet for ever-

Whenoe ff thou plemen ω behold the wthly night
which thau lust lest,

Thnse tynum whfieh the people fen· will seem os
