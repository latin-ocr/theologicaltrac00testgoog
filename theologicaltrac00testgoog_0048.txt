DE TRINITATE

They are mmrporeal. ’ But since the Father is God,
the son is θοὰ, md the Holy spirit is God, and since
there are in God no points os fflfferenoe distinguisffing
Hini from God, He differs from none of the Others.
But where there are no differeuces there is rio
plumhty ; where is no plurality there is Unity*
Again, nothing but God can be bega-tte„ of God, and
lastly, in concrete euumerations the repetition of
units does not produce plurality. Thus the Unity of
the Three is suiubly established.

But since no relation un be affirm-ed of one sub-
ject alone, immuch as n predicate wanting relation
is a predicate of substance, the manifoldness of the
Trinity is secui-ed through the category οἱ· relation,
md the Unity is maintained through the fact that
there is no differem-e of substance, or operation, or
generally αἲ any substantia! predicate* So then, the
divine substance preserves the Unity, the divine rela-
tions bring sbout the Tn'uity. Hence only terms
belonging to relation my be applied singly to Each.
For the Father is not the same as the Son, nor is
either of 'rhem the same ns the Holy Spirit. Yet
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are ench the same
evod, the same in justice‚in goodness,in greatness,
md in everything that m be predicate-1 of sul>
sunem One must not forget that predienoes of
relativsty do not always involve relation to some-
thing other than the subject, ns slave involves
master, where the two terma are differem.- For
equnls are ιρι-Δ, like are like, identimls are identical,
each wilh other, and the relation of Faber ω Son,
md of both to Holy Spirit is a. relation of identicaln.
