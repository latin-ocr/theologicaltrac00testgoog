different things. But if they were nothing else

virtue of Being; the secondnry good is in its turn
good because it derives from the good whose absolute
Being is good. But the absolute Being of nll things
derives frum the Prime Good which is such that of
lt Being and Goodness are rightly predicated as
identieal. Their absolute Being therefore is ζωᾶς
for therehy it resides in Him.
