CONTRA EVTYCHEN

between Nature md Person, tint is, οὐσία md
menam. The exnet venne wine-li should be applied
in ench ease must be lest to the deeision of ecelesi-
muca] usage⁴ For the time being let that distinction
between Noun-e md Person hold which 1 have
ami-med, viz. thaz Nature is the δρψ-ῆς property οι·
my subshnee, und Person the individual substa-nee

Pei-nnn wan twofnid, being led nstrny by the celse
notion that Person may be »applied to every nature.
For on this assumption, un ersbnnding that there
were in Christ two mtures, he declaret] that there
were likewise two pensons. And nithough the defini-
tion which we have already given is enough w prove
Nestorius wrong, his error shall be further dedan-ed
hy the following argument. If the Person of Christ
is not single, md if it is clear tim there are in Him
two nnturee, to wit, divine nnd human (nnd no one
will be so foolish ns ω fni} to include either in the
definiti-in), it follows tium there must apparently be
two pensons; for Person, ns im been said, is the in-
dividua! substance os a rational nature.

Whni kind of nnion, then, between God md innn

the other—the kind of unicm which the Greeks term
κατὰ παράθεσιν “ by juxt-:position *¹ ? But if hummity
has been united to divinity in this way no one thing
has been soi-nied out of the two, and hence Christ is
nothing. The very nme of Christ, indeed, dex-intes

have above described took place, there could be no
