is made were itself substance, ns mm οι· God is sub-
stance. But there is a difference: since mn is not
simply and entirely men, und therefore is not sub-
stance nster all. For what mm is he owes w other
things which are not mrum⁴ But God is sim ly and
entirely God, for He is nothing else than w ut He
is, end therefore is, through simple existence, God*
