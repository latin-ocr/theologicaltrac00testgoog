NOTE ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ΤΕΧΤ

Tite text of the Opucula Sacra is bned ou my own
oollntions of all the imponant manuscripts of these
vorke. An efficit-n with wmplete appmmm critica
will be ready before long for the viem Corpus
sm'pmm Eoelemimm Latinorum* The history
os the text of the Opumhz Sam, as Ι shall attempt
bu show elsewhere, is intimately connected with that

of the Gnmhtio.
