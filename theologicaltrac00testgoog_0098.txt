OONTRA EVTYCHEN

a kind ns to include all things tint are. It will
accordingly be something of this kind: “Nature
belongs w those things which, since they exist, eu·
m some mmm be apprehenda} by the mind?
This definition‚ theu, includes both accidents md
subsannes, fur 'they a'll cau be epprehended by the
mind But 1 add‘ ‘in smne menmire 'bet-nusae God
und matter munuc be apprehendet! by mind, be it
never so whole end perfect, but still they are uppre-
hended iu a mensure thmugh the removal of accidente
The reason for edeling the words, ‘¹ since they exisff'
is that the mere word “ nothing ’¹ denotes something,
though it does not denote nature⁴ For it denotes,
indeed, not thet mything is, but rather non—existenoe3
but every mure existe Amne we ehooee ιο ,ῆι-ω
1‘ mure ’¹ of the wamy of things, the definitior· wffl
be es we heve given it above.

But if “natiue'' is affirmed of substances alone,
we shall, since all substances are either coivereal or
incorporal, give to nature denoting substances n de-
finifion os the following kind: “ Nabure is either that
which ωτι net or that which om be acted upon.
Now the power ω act md ω suffer belongs w nll

Here, then, you have n further definitiun of what
nature is ns applied ω substa-aces alone. This defini-
tion compi-ins also the definiti->n of substance. For
if the word nature signis-ies substance, when once we
have defined nature we have also settled the defini-
tion of substance* But if we neglect incorporal
subeam-es end confine the nme nature to eol-peren
subsaunes so thet they alone appear to possess the
nature of substance—which is the view of Aristotle
