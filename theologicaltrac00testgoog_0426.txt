CONSOLAT. Pfflmsopn. V.

contemplator or divinity is mpthle. For 1 win
mswer that the same thing is necessary when it is
referred to the Divine knowledge3 but when it is
weighed in its own nature thet it seemeth altogether
free «md absolute. For there be two necessities:
the one simple, as thet it is necessary for all men to
he mnndi the other conditional, sn if thou knowest

whieh though they eome ω pets hy being, yet they
lose not their own nature, because before they came
to pen, they might tiso not have happened. But
