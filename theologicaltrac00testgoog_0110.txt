CONTRA EVTYCHEN

the term substance ω them is this: This term was
upplied ω things of higher vidue, in uider that what
is mm excellent might be distinguished, if not by a
definiti-m of nature nnswering bo the litei-al meaning
of ὗφίινταπθαιεευὸπεακ, at my rate by the words
ὑπόντωιςεηῠεωιιιία.

To begin with, then, man is essenee, 122. οὐσία,
subsistence, 122. οὰνίωσις, ὑπόστασις, ιι4 substance,
πρόσωπον, ⁸22. person: οὐσία or essentia because he is,
‹uk-{amm οι· ςιὼεἰςίειιοε because he is not accidenti!
ιο ‚my subject, ὑπόστασις or subsanna because he is
subject to 211 the things which are not subsistences
m· οὖινιώσεις, while he is πρόσωπον οι- person bemuse
he is a rationnl individual. Next, God isvoiim'a οι-
εεεειισε, for He is aud is es eeially that fmm which
proceeds the Being of ,ιι ings. To Him belong
υῦσὶωσις, ιἰ. ςιὼειειεηοε, fur He subsists iu absolute
indepen'denee, and ὗφίιντιισθαι, for He is substantia]
Reii-g. Wheiiee we go οι, to say that there is one
ουσία οι· utin-imas, ie. one esseuce or subsistence of
the Godhend, but three mam-dms or substances
And indeed, following this use, men have spoken of
One essenee, three substances md thien persons of
the (30th 1³01 did not the lang-nge of the
Cluui-eh forbid us ω say three subsannes in speaking
of God,·² substance might seem a right term to apply
ω 1-1im, not hemum He andei-lies ,ιι other things
like ι substratae, but because, just as He exeells
above ull things, so He is the foundation mid support
ocehings, supplying them ιιι with οὐσιῶσθω 01- int»
sistence.
