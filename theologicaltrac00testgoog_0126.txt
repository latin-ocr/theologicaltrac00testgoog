CONTRA EVTYCHEN

that is useless. Ami to what useful end shall we
say this great humilhtion of Divinity was wrought if
ruined mm has not been saved hy the conception
und the Pession os Christ—for they denied that he
was taken into Godhead? Onne more then, just as
the error ut* Eutychus took its rise from the same
source as that of Nestorius, ao it hastens to the sanie
goal inasxnueh as according to Eutyches also the
human rece hm not been mem* sime mn who was

into Godhead. Yet this is the conclusion he seems tn

Christ's body was not taken really from man but from
a source outside him und prepared for the purpose in
heaven, for He is believed to have aseended with it up

heth nst-ended into heaven save Him who came down
from heaven.

neither substance kept its proper form. But if God-
head vms translated into manhuod, that has happened
which piety forhids us to believe, viz. while the men-
hood continued in unehnngeahle substance Godhead
was changed, and that which was by nature passible
and mut-able remained immntable, while that which
we heiieve to be by mure immunihle end impessible
