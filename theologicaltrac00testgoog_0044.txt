DE TRINITATE

nothing about ies beiug mything, but simply amm
to it, so to spes-k, something exteml. Thooe ente-
gories which desei-ibe a thing in tei-ms of its substance
may be called substantia] ontegories; when they
apply ιο things ss subjecta they are called accidentis.

Let ns now consider the eutegory of relat-ion, to
which ull the soregoing remarks have been relimin-
nry; for quulities which obviously asise um the

the thing, the thing disappem as soon as you suppress
the semideum quality whiteuess, But m the ease
of master, if you suppress the tei-m slave, the tei-m
master disappenrs. But slave is not an wcidental
quulizy of maeeeu, as whitenese is of a white thium

slave. Now since the power goes when tue slave is
removed, it is plain thot power is no occident to the

It cunnot therefore be affin-med that a cstegory os

substance of the thing to which it is upplied. The
