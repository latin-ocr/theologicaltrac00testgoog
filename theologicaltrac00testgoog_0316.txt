OONSOLAT. PHIDOSOPH. 111.

The guilty souls with puins ⁰pprest,
Moved with his song began to weep.
Ixion’s wheel now standing still

Turne not his hemi with mofiuns steep.
Though Tantalus might drink at will,
To quench his thiu-st he would fon-bear<
The vulture full with music shrill

Dum unt poor ’tityus‘ laver tm

‘We by his verses conquered arel

suth the great King whom spirits fen:
¹ Le: us not then from him debu·

His wife whom he with songs deth ain.
Yet lest our gist should streteh boo ar,
We will it with this law resi-min,

That when from hell he halus his ssight,
He shnss from looking back ren-ain:
Who can fm- lovers hws findite?

Leve hath no law but her own will.
Orpheus, meing nn the ven-ge of night
Eurydice, doeh lose and kssl

Her and himself with soolish Ιονε,

But you this reigned mle fulfil,

Who think uum the day *bove

To bring wau, speed your darkwme mmm
Fur if, your eye wnquered, you move
Baekwnsd to mum lest behind,

An the rich prey which thence you wok,
Yon lose while back w hell you look.”
