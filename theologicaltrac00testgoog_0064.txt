QVOMODO SVBSTANTIAE

But those things whose substance is good are sub-
smfihuy ἔωσι But they owe tlleil' notunl Being
to absolute Being. Their absolute Bting therefore
is good5 therefore the absolute Being of all things
ii good. But ii· thei: Being is good, things which
exist are good through the fact that they exist and
their absolute Being is the same as that of the Good.
Therefore they are substantia} goods, since they du
not merely participate in goodness. But if their
absolute Bai-243 is good, there is no doubt but that,
since they are substantia! goods, they are like the
First Good and therefore they will have to be that
Gnod. For nothing is like lt save ltseifi Hence
⁸11 things that ure, are Gaul—an impious assertioni.
πει-εἰπε things m not substantia! gomis, md so
the essenoe of the Good cloes not reside in them.
Therefore they ure not good through the fiet that
they exist. But neither do they receive good by
participationi, for they would in no wise tend to guod.
Therefore they ore in no wise good!
