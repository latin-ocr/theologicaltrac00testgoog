proportior. ‚md εφη] or only sugm nnequal, they are
really mingled md tempered by ιῙνιε qunlities which
are in moder-te relation tn euch other. This indeed
takes place in bodies but not in all bodies, hut only
in those, as has been said, which are capable os
wapro-21 ‚enon nnd influence -nd nave the same
matter subject to their qualine& For ..ΙΙ bodies
which subsint in nunditiam of birth and decay seem
ιο possess a oomnmn matter, but au bodies are not
capable of reeiprocrl aetion and influence⁴ But eor-
porenls cannot in any way be changed into incorporeals
because they do not snm in any common nnderl · g
matter which can be changed ineo this or um t ing
by taking on its qunh'ties. For the nature of nn in-
cur-porea] snbsrnnce reses upon n material basim bnt
there is no body that has not matter as a subm-ate.
Since this is so, und since not even thom things which
naturally have n common matter cm pass over into
each uther unless they have the power of neting on
emh other and bear-g anoed upon by each other, far
nme vm those things not suffer inter-change which
not only have no common matter but are different in
substance, since one oi* them, being body, rests on a
nmis os nutoer, while the other, being incorporem,
cannot possibly stand in need of a material substate„

lt is therefore impossible sor n body to he ehunged
inm nn incorporal speeies, nor will ie ever be possible
for incorporeals ω be changed into each other by
my process of mingling. For things 'which have no
