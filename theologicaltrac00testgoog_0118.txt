CONTRA EVTYCHEN

Spin-it of God forehahi the coming Christ, fm- which
cause they mo were called Christe. So now it follows
thnt so long ns the Perrnns ranan, we mnnot in any
vise believe that humanit has been munuca by
divinity. For things which differ nlike in persons
md nntnres are certainly separate, my .hso1noe1y
sepmte3 man and oxen are not further separate than
art divinity and hnmnity in Christ, if the Per-sons
have temni-med. Men indeed and oxen axe united in
one animal nature, for hy genus they have a common
suhsnnee und the same nature in the collection which
forms the universalst But God md man will be at
all point-s fundunenfflly differentis we are ω believe
thnt distinction of Pei-sons continues under differ-enee
of nature. ’rhen the human rm hnc not been saved,
the birth of Christ has brought us no salvanum-1, fixe
writings of nn the pmphets have but heguiled the
people that believed in them, contempt is pon-red
u u the authority of the whole Old Tesmment
w *eh promised to the world salvatinn by the hirst·
of christ. It is phin that salvan-on hns nnt been
brought nr, if there n the same differem in
Person that there is in Nature* No doubt He saved
that humnnity which we believe He msumed3 hut

Wherefore mm's nature hus not boen saved by the
