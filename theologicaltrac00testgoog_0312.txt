OONSOLAT. PHIDOSOPH. 111.

go out, where thou mmest in, or dost thou frume
a wonderful simle of the simplieity of God? For a
little before taking thy beginning from blessednees,
thou affirmedst zhnt to be the nhiefoet good which
thou minist was placed in God, md likewise thou

school thot our s ethes must be like ud ns it
