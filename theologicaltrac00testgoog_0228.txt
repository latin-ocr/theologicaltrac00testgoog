a free mind? Cal-ist thou remove a sunl settled in
firm reason from the quiet suite which it maesseth?
When a tymnt thought to eompel a certain free mn
by toi-ments ω hewrny his concedentes of t oon-
spirney attempted against him, he bit off hie tangue,

forced to sustam hy mother? We reid that nunni,
want to kill his guenta, war himself slain hy his
guest Hercules.» Regulus hid laid feners upon

Wherefore thinkett thou the power of that man ιο
