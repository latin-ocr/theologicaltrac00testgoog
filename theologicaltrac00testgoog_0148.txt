THE FIRST BOOK OF
BOE'I'HIUS¹

CONTAINING HIS COMPLAINT AND
MISERIES

L

I Tan· with youthful beat did verses write,
Must now my waes in doleful tunes indite.
My work is framea by Muses tom ‚md rude,
Ami my sad eheeks are with true teus bedeweni:
For these alone no tex-tor could affray
From being pumex-s of my weary way.
The nrt that was my young life¹ s joy aud glory
Beeomes my solace now l'm old md so
Snmw lma fllehed my youth from me, the ’thies'
My days are numbered not by time but Griess*
Untimely honry haim cover my head,
Ami my loose skm quakes on my αρε». rmlr dead.
Ο happy death, that spnreth sweetest years,

d eomes in sorrow osten called with tems>
Abu, how deas is he bo wretch's cries;
And laath he is ιο close up weeping eyes;
