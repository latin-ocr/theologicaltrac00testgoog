Ηο that ω honour only κείς to mount

And that his chiefest end doth munt,
Let him behold dle lurgeness of the skies

And on the struit emh east his eyes
He will desplse the glnry ns luis name,

Which annot fill so mall a frume-

Why dgegrroud men soom that their neela should

That yoke which every man must wear?
Though fune through nmny rufinus fly along
And should be blazed by every magne,
And houses shine with our forefnthers' εωτίεε,
Yet Denth centenam these sffately glories
And, summo “ bod: rich and pont to die,
Makes the ow equal with file high.
Who known where faithful fabrice* bones are pressed,
Where Brutus md stu-iet Cato rest ?¹¹
A sleuder fame consigna their tffles vain
ln some few letters to romain*
Because their famous names in books we md,
Come we by them ω know the dead?
Yon dying, then, remembered are by none,
Nol· nn fame eun make you known.
But le you inl< that lsfe onestrippeth death,
Your names borne up wit}- mortal breath,
When length of time takes this away likewise,
A mund death shall you surprise.
