NOTE ΟΝ THE TEXT

hv prepsring the text of the amidio Ι have used

Tegernseensis, are gener-Hy amunte und complete ς
I heve depended 21⁸0 on my own oollations or
excerpts from various of the important manuscripts,
nearly all of which 1 luve nt least exnmined, aud
I have also followed, not always but usually, the
opinions of Engelbreeht in his admirable article, Dic
ConmlafioPlfihaopkiaeduBoemiusintheSitzmgaebericl-ee
of the Vienna Amdemy, cxliv. (1902) 1-60. The
present text, then, hu been eonstrueted from only
port of the material with which an editor should
reekon, though the reader may at least assume
that every reading in the text hus, unless otherwise
stated, the authority of some manuscript of the

We look to August Engelbreeht for the first critical
edition of the Com-obuio at, we hope, no dieunt
date.
