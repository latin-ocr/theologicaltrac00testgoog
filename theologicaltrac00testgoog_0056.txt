VTRVM PATER ET FILIVS

Spirat wo is not the same ns the Father and the Sem⁴
Hence we guther that rather, Son, md 1—101y Spirit
ne not predicate-1 of the Divinity in a substantial
manner, but othon-wisza Fur ff each mm. wem predi-
eabed substantially it would be affirmed of the three
Pet-suns hot}- separavely md collectively. It is
evadent that these tex-ms are relative, for the Fathex
is some nne' s Fnther, the Son is seme one’s Son, the
Spint ιε some one s Sgirit. Hence not even Trinity
may be substantially predicator] of God3 for the
Father· ιε not Trinity-siuee He who is Father is not
Son md Holy Spirit——nor yet, by purity of reasoning,
is the Son ττι-ιιι), „01 the Holy Spirat Trinity, hut
the Trinity connium iu diversity of Pers-ms, the Unity
in simplieity of subse-mee.

Now if the Persona are separate, while the Sub-
smnce is undivided, it must needs be unt that tenu
which is derived from Persons does not belong to
Substmce* But the Trinity is effeeted by divmity
os Perseus, whetefore Trinity does not belong ω
Summa-e. Hence neither Father, nor son, nor
Holy Sp· ιιι, nor Trinity ean be substantially pre-
diented of God, but only relntively, as we have said.
But Gnd, Truth, Justiee, Goodness, Omnipotence,
Substanee, Ιιιιιιιυίᾱδῦἰῐγ, virtue, Wisdom and all
other eonceivable predicantes osche kind are applicnble
