CONSOLAT⁴ ,PHImSOPI-l. Ι,

mntend with the chief Praetor himself, and the
matter was discusse-i before the King, und 1 prevniled
so far that it went not forward. 1 drew Paulinus,
who had been Consul, out of the very mouth of the
guping courtiers, who like ravennas curs had already
in hope and ambition devoured his rinhes. Thnt
Albinus who had likewise been Consul might not be
puniahed npon preanmptuousu and mse neeusation,
Ι exposed myself to the hatred of Cyprian his althenses·⁴
May 1 seem to have pmvoked enmity enough against
mysels? But others should so much the mure have
procur-ed my sufety, since blut for the love 1 bear w
justice 1 lest myself no way by the means of court-iem
ιο be aasz> But by whose accusations did Ι receive
this blov? By theim who, long since having put
naun nut of the King¹s service, canapened him now
to accuse me, by the necessity which he was driven
ω hy debtt Opilio hkewne und Gaudentius being
bnnished hy the King's deeree, sor the injur-ies und
munisold deceits which they had commithed, because
they would not ahey, defended thensselves hy taking
sanctuary, os which the King hearing, gave sentence,
that unless they departed out of the city of Ravenna
within certain days, they should be branded in the
foreheads, and put out by force. What could be
added ω this severity? And yet that very day
their accusatione against nae went sm· current. What

before, make them just accusers? Wns not fortune
ashumed, if not that innoeency was aueused, yet ut

what mane ms lan-d to my clange? wat thou have
it in one word? I am said ιο hnve desired the
