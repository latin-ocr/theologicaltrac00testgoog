These preumimrxes are enough then sor our
purpose. The intelligent interpreter of the discussion
will supply the “gumen-ite appropriate to ench point.

Now the problem is this. Thingn which ue, ure
good. For ³11 the leamed ure »gi-ced that every
existing thing tenes m ami everything cendi
ω its like. 'steteram t ¹ gs which tend w good
are good. We must, however, inquire how they
are good-hy pam-cipum οι by substance. 1f
hy participationi, they m in no wisc good in them-
selves3 for a thing which is white by pnrtieipaiion
in vhiteness is unt white in itseh· by vim-e of
absolute Being. So with ull other qualities. If
theu they are good ῑῖζ participationi, they are not
good in themselves erefore they do not tend ω
ςοοᾱΑ But we have agreed that they do. Therefm
they are good not by partieipntion but by substan-ze.
