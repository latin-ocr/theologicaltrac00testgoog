το JOHN THE DEACON

WHETHER FATHER, SON, AND HOLY
SPIRI'r MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY
PREDICATED OF THE DIVINITY

Tun queefion before us is whether Faeher, Son, md
³⁰¹5 spffit my be predscated of the Divinity sub-
smntmly or otherwise. And I think thst the method
of our inquiry must be bon-:owed from what is ad-
mittedly the surest source of ³11 truth, namely, the
fundamental doctrines of the catholic faith. If,
then, 1 uk whether He who is called Father is n
substance, the answer will be yes. If 1 ask whether
the Son is ι substance, the reply wiu be the same.
So, wo, no one wiu hesitare ω affirm that the 1-101y
spu-it is ,ιω n substance, But when, on the oum
hund, 1 take together ull three, Father, Son, md
Hnly Spin-it, the result is not three subsunces but
one substance. The one subsnuce of the Three,
then, cannot be separated or divided, nor isit made
